![Jarvis](./img/jarvis2.jpeg)

- Jarvis is an AI personal assistant project built using Python. It is designed to assist users with various tasks, making their lives easier and more productive.
- Inspired by the AI assistant from the Iron Man, Jarvis can perform a wide range of functions, including answering questions, managing tasks, providing news updates, and more.

## Features
- **Voice Interaction:** Jarvis can listen to voice commands and respond using text-to-speech technology, creating a natural and interactive experience.

- **Speech Recognition:** Powered by speech recognition libraries, Jarvis can accurately understand user voice commands and process them accordingly.

- **Task Management:** Jarvis can help you manage your to-do lists, set reminders, and schedule events, keeping you organized and on track.

- **News Updates:** Jarvis will search in wikipedia for information as per your request

- **Play Songs:** Jarvis can play your saved songs in your local machine. Just give it the command.

- **Web Search:** Ask Jarvis questions or request information, and it will open tabs in chrome, searches to find relevant answers and present them to you.

- **Jokes:** Ask Jarvis to tell you a joke. It will crack you up

- **Takes Screenshot:** JArvis can take screenshots!

- **System Monitoring:** Jarvis can monitor system resources, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and battery status, to keep you informed about your device's performance.

- **Logout**, **Shutdown** and **Restart:** Jarvis can do all this in your local machine.

- **AI Learning:** The more you interact with Jarvis, the more it learns about your preferences and adapts to your needs.
